## Node 
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js + ExpressJS allows us to run a local server on our machine with javascript!. Download and install Node [here].(https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

# Build and Run Project
## Install
When you pull/clone/download this project from github, you need to install some dependencies to get the server going.
```
git clone <THIS_PROJ>
cd THIS_PROJ
npm install
```

## Run
Once these dependencies are installed just run this command in the root folder of the project in the terminal!
```
npm run start
```

This starts the server and hosts the project on the following url:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```
